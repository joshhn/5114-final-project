-- Loads alert informed-entity route/stop mappings from RAW_ALERTS into FACT_ALERTS_ROUTES.
-- One row per unique (entity_id, route_id, stop_id), keeping the newest snapshot when duplicates exist.
-- Merge avoids regression when older backfill dates are rerun after newer data has already loaded.
-- Used Claude Sonnet 4.6 for help with the merging logic.
