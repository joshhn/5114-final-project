-- Used for getting on time performance metric by calculating the % of stop events with is_on_time = TRUE
-- Built from:
--   FACT.FACT_VEHICLE_POSITIONS  (we'll get rows where current_status = STOPPED_AT (when vehicles ACTUALLY stop at the stop_id for the trip))
--   STATIC.DIM_STOP_TIMES        (scheduled times (EXPECTED stop times))
--   STATIC.DIM_TRIPS             (needed for direction_id)
--   STATIC.DIM_ROUTES            (needed for route_type and route name)
