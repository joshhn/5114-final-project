-- for this metric, there's usually only a few alerts per route id
-- in the visualization, it probably makes the most sense to view this aggregated over all routes for a particular day, as a stacked bar chart for the type of alert counts.
-- we could also use this to show which routes have the most alerts over a specified period of time
